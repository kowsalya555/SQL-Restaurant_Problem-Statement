Introduction to the problem statement
========================
We have a data sets  
We need to decide based on the spending patterns of a restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: pizza, pasta and burger.
We need to provide the assistance to help the restaurant in the market - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but 
we need to solve on how to use their data to help them run the business.
